        Modifications on Quake 2 and Quake 4 (Technologies Used: QuakeC, C, C++)
      </h1>
      <p style={{ paddingLeft: "5pt", textIndent: "0pt", textAlign: "left" }}>
        Made 1 mod for Quake 2 (in C) and Quake 4 (in C++) each. The first has
        to do with replacing several weapons in the game with upgradable
        weapons, in addition to an upgrade system that improves the player
        attributes and weapons by using the souls of the enemies defeated. The
        Second has to do with a much simpler class creation, dealing with 3
        different classes with 3 different abilities and weapons
